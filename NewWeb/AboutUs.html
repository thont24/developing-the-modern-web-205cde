                <p style="width:500px">I am currently studying Multi-Media Computing at Coventry University, where i have worked on a range of different projects for my first year including games, a drawing app, 3D model of the building and more. Besides from my studies i spend
                    my time cycling, playing and watching rugby and playing video games.</p>

                <p style="width:500px">I work at JDW otherwise widely knows as Wetherspoons, as a bar associate. I deal with different customers everyday which requires a good set of customer service skills to handle them all. Along with the workload and difficulties of the
                    job i actually really enjoy it. I have been there three months now and have never had a bad day with the company.</p>

                <p style="width:500px">I work as part of a small team of around 15-20 people to keep the pub running and serving customers with a high satisfactory rate. We aim to give our customers a nice experience whilst also having a good time ourselves.</p>
