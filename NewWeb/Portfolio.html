            <p style="float: left"><b>Death From Below (Project 1, Game)</b></p>

            <p style="width: 70%; float: left">This was my first project we did in a team of 5 at unviersity, this took us 6 weeks and we had a finished version of the game with a few glithces as you can expect. This game is based in the fiery depths of hell in which you have to make your
                way through the levels collecting coins and topping up your highscore whilst navigating the mazes and destroying any enemies that may be in your path. Collecting health pickups throughout the levels, make your way to the portal on the
                other side of the maze to progress through the game. Be cautions, you only get one life, so make it count!
                <BR />
                <BR /> Skills that i gained in this project went from basic coding in scratch from creating some of the visual assets in photoshop for the game. This expanded my knowledge of photoshop a lot and also dove me a litle deeper into the world of
                programming.

            <BR />
            <BR />
            <BR />

            <p style="width: 50%; float:right">Infinitive sketch came about when a small group of students were set the task of making a drawing app for Android. As we went through the ropes of designing a skeumorphic design we then decided we preferred flat design, and is what you see
                on the left of you, our flat design interface.
                <BR />
                <BR />

                <i>The actual app itself presents the user with the ability to do many things, the main ones we are proud of are:<BR /><BR /> 
                
                - Opacity tool<BR />
                - Background fill<BR /> 
                - Eraser rubbs out to the same colour as background<BR />
                - Rollover icons as you can see on the brush at the bottom<BR /> 
                - Brush sizes, and of course our logo.<BR /><BR /></i> All in all this is an effective and working drawing app that we plan to release onto the Android market shortly. We designed this app using photoshop and coded it using
                processing. This allowed for the effective creation of our drawing app. For this project i also gained a lot more skills than the first project. Along with a lot more photoshop for all of the icons you see hear on the right i also had
                to do proper coding i.e. Processing Java. Using tools such as inner shadow and drop shadow, along with playing with the opacity i created an effective flat design for the app. Following that in processing i used coding to create rollover
                buttons and an eraser tool. These were very basic to start with but i applied myself and practised and now i am learning to code effectively.

            <p style="width: 60%; float:left">For this project we were tasked to create a waypoint system for the building that we work in the the ECB. We were tasked to model the building and then create video paths aroudn the building in which users could view in order to find their
                way around. The way we did this was by video rednering out of 3DS Max. The project itself was a simple idea but the work that had to be done was immense:
                <BR />
                <BR />

                <i>
                - Model the entire ECB building<BR />
                - Make and design a low, mid and high user interface for the app<BR />
                - Code the app so that all of the main aspects work<BR />
                - Test for errors, bug bixing and usability with an audience as big as you could get<BR /><BR /></i> This proved to be a challenging but rewarding application in which we took our time with and made to a high standard in
                order to get a good finished product.

            <p style="width: 70%; float:right">Throughout the developement of this app i worked long hours in order to get a good looking and effective app by the end of it. I used lots of tools in the development of my model such as extrude, bevel, chamfer, bridge, along with textures
                by using the material editor i was then able to create realistic and effective looking models. To enhance this further i started using shortcuts to enable me to model faster and better enabling more time for other things.
                <BR />
                <BR /> Programming wise we used something called ControlP5 a library which enables its users to create effective user interfaces like you see for my app. This library included making the interface the certain colours we wanted, controlevents,
                arrays and various other programming skills. All together we managed to develop a good working app that included some very technical skills involved.

                <BR />

                <i>The modelling itself was very enjoyable, and was one of my favourite modules over the course of the year, i felt like these few points are where i was most effective:<BR /><BR /> 
                
                - Using a variey of different approaches<BR />
                - Using many of the tools available<BR /> 
                - Always do your research before beginning to model<BR />
                - Working from memory s very off-putting, and working from an image or picture is much handier.<BR /> 
                - Make the model as realistic to the object as you can.<BR /><BR /></i>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP3ktH7Z3No">'Here'</a> to go to my older YouTube channel and you can have a look and a render of my
                models, doing a flythough of the building, which helped to piece together the ECB CoPilot app which we talked about above.</b>

            <p style="width: 60%; float:left">For this project we were tasked to create a shortvideo using Kinetic Typography. We were allowed to choose which video we wanted to cover and i went for ET the Hip Hop preacher because i find him inspiring and a true spirit. <BR /><BR />
            Kinetic Typography is when you take the visuals away from a video and add a text overlay instead, as and when the words are spoken so the people can read them. So for example as someone might say "Help" you read that on the screen. Admittedly mine is only a simple one but none the less.<BR /><BR />
            I made this using Adobe Premier, placing the video and then removing it leaving only the Audio. Then tediously went along listening and adding the words as he speaks them, leaving this YouTube video. Enjoy.
